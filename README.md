# iDLG with cosine similarity

This repo contains code for final project paper of ECSE 4964. The proposed method combines and involves two main components: Extracting ground truth labels before the reconstruction process and optimizing gradient using a cost function based on cosine similarity.

## What's inside?

The script contains a sample reconstruction for three methods: The traditional DLG, improved DLG (iDLG), and iDLG with cosine similarity (our proposed method).

All three methods were configured identically using the LeNet model, the CIFAR-100 dataset, a learning rate of 0.1, 300 iterations, and the LBFGS optimizer. 

## How to use 

Set up your Python environment and install the required packages. Then run the script.
